# <font color="darkgreen"> Systematic evaluation of robustness to cell type mismatch of deconvolution methods for spatial transcriptomics data </font>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Spatial transcriptomics approaches based on sequencing (barcode-based, e.g., 10x Visium) preserve spatial information but with limited cellular resolution. On the other hand, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques provide single-cell resolution but lose spatial resolution because of the tissue dissociation step during the scRNA-seq experimental procedure. With these complementary strengths in mind, computational methods have been developed to combine scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. These approaches use deconvolution to identify cell types and their respective proportions at each location in spatial transcriptomics data with the aid of a scRNA-seq reference dataset. Some suggest that deconvolution approaches are sensitive to the absence of cell type(s) in the single-cell reference dataset, a problem referred to as *cell type mismatch*.

Spatial transcriptomics approaches based on sequencing (barcode-based, e.g., 10x Visium) preserve spatial information but with limited cellular resolution. On the other hand, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques provide single-cell resolution but lose spatial resolution because of the tissue dissociation step during the scRNA-seq protocol. With these complementary strengths in mind, computational methods have been developed to combine scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. These approaches use deconvolution to identify cell types and their respective proportions at each location in spatial transcriptomics data with the aid of a scRNA-seq reference dataset. Some suggest that deconvolution approaches are sensitive to the absence of cell type(s) in the single-cell reference dataset, a problem referred to as *cell type mismatch*.
Here, we systematically evaluated the robustness of deconvolution methods to cell type mismatch tailored for spatial transcriptomics data.

#### Content of the Processing directory

**0_SoftwareEnvironment**:
This directory enlists the software environment specifications used during the project.

**Data**: Comprised of pre-processed data either downloaded from a public data-sharing platform or procured from the group of Lisa van Baarsen.

**1\_Generate\_sc\_ref\_data**: The directory comprises scripts, results and settings to generate the integrated scRNA-seq dataset from 2 distinct and complementary scRNA-seq datasets. The final result `sc.ref.data.rds` is used in the further downstream analysis as a reference dataset for generating simulated spatial transcriptomics datasets and as an input to deconvolution methods.

#### How can you reproduce the results in the manuscript?

1. Software environment for R and Python used during the original analysis can be found under the`/0_SoftwareEnvironment` directory.


2. For reproducibility, the project utilises renv functionality. To setup renv functionalities for your analysis, please follow the steps below;
	
	i. Read [getting started with renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html) carefully to understand the functionalities provided by the renv R package.
	
	ii. Creating an R project in RStudio: `RStudio > File > New Project > Existing Directory > Select the /Processing` directory in the sFSS. You can refer to [RStudio projects](https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200526207-Using-RStudio-Projects) for more details on how the projects in RStudio work.
	
<<<<<<< HEAD
	**III**. Executing `Renv_Setup.R` under the `/Processing` directory to initialise the renv infrastructure for the R project:
	- The `Renv_Setup.R` script expects a **GITHUB_PAT token (classic)** to be set in the R environment. Please make sure you edit the script to add your own token. More details on the github token can be found [here](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens).
	- If using RStudio: execute the script line-by-line, read the comments within the scripts.
	- If using bash/shell terminal: <br>
		&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;<font color="blue" size=4>`Rscript Renv_setup.R`</font> 
=======
	iii. Open `Renv_Setup.R` under the `/Processing` directory in the newly created R project in RStudio and execute the script line-by-line.
>>>>>>> parent of c830ac4 (Updated scripts for better reproducibility)
		
		The required files (renv.lock, .Rprofile, renv/activate.R) should already be in your R project directory;
		If not, ensure it resides in the same directory as the Renv_setup.R file.

### How to execute the 6\_Quick_Results module?

### Issues:

**1. Installation of 'fields' R package on macOS**

The analysis is carried out with fields package version 13.3 developed under R version 4.1 and RStudio built for x86\_64 architecture.

If you use MacOS with arm\_64 architecture and install RStudio built for x86\_64 architecture, it will use the underlying 'Rosetta2' to run RStudio with x86\_64 architecture, and you will able to install the required 13.3 version of the fields package from CRAN archives.
But if you install RStudio built for arm\_64, it will run with the native silicon chip, and then you will get the error below,

</details>

to resolve this error, 

- you can install the latest version 15.2 ([R-binaries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fields/index.html) available for arm\_64); this will affect the CARD package since it needs to be updated to the latest version as well.

- install R and RStudio built for x86\_64 architecture and run the analysis using it. If you still get the same error, the compiler uses the default arm\_64 architecture to install R packages that need compilation.

<br>

**2. Compilation failed error on Windows OS**

R and RStudio on Windows OS require rtools (a toolchain for building R and R packages). The correct version of rtools can be downloaded from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

	Ensure you do not have white spaces in your paths while installing the rtools.

**3. Miniconda installation prompt**

		No non-system installation of Python could be found.
		Would you like to download and install Miniconda?
		Miniconda is an open-source environment management system for Python.
		See https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html for more details.
		 
		Would you like to install Miniconda? [Y/n]:

If you see above prompt in your execution of analysis, press `n` and stop the execution.

Before moving forward please check your python installation before moving forward with `Sys.which("python")` or `Sys.which("python3")` in RStudio console.

- If you see `" "`, please install the python version 3.9.7 and try again.
- If you see `"/path_to_python_installation"`, please contact the developer or create an issue on the GitHub repository with the error message, R session info, and python installation details (path, version, etc).
