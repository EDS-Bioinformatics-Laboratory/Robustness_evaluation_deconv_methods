# <font color="darkgreen"> Systematic evaluation of robustness to cell type mismatch of deconvolution methods for spatial transcriptomics data </font>

&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; Spatial transcriptomics approaches based on sequencing (barcode-based, e.g., 10x Visium) preserve spatial information but with limited cellular resolution. On the other hand, single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) techniques provide single-cell resolution but lose spatial resolution because of the tissue dissociation step during the scRNA-seq experimental procedure. With these complementary strengths in mind, computational methods have been developed to combine scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics data. These approaches use deconvolution to identify cell types and their respective proportions at each location in spatial transcriptomics data with the aid of a scRNA-seq reference dataset. Some suggest that deconvolution approaches are sensitive to the absence of cell type(s) in the single-cell reference dataset, a problem referred to as *cell type mismatch*.

Here, we systematically evaluated the robustness of deconvolution methods to cell type mismatch tailored for spatial transcriptomics data.

## <font color = "green">Content of the Processing directory</font>

* **0_SoftwareEnvironment**:
This directory enlists the software environment specifications used for various programming languages and/or platforms during the project.

* **1\_Generate\_sc\_ref\_data**: The directory comprises scripts, results and settings to generate the integrated scRNA-seq dataset from 2 distinct and complementary scRNA-seq datasets. The final result **`sc.ref.data.rds`** is used as a basis to generate various reference dataset versions based on cell type removal scenarios and to generate simulated spatial transcriptomics datasets.

* **2\_Simulating\_ST\_data**: Comprised of scripts, results and settings to generate the sequencing-based simulated spatial transcriptomics datasets varying in number of cells & cell types present per spatial location (spot). We created three simulated ST datasets using the algorithm developed for the analysis. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; a. **<font color="brown">ST1</font>**: 4-8 cell types and 10-15 cells per spot; <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; b. **<font color="brown">ST2</font>**: 1-5 cell types and 10-15 cells per spot; <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; c. **<font color="brown">ST3</font>**: 1-5 cell types and 3-7 cells per spot.


* **3\_ST\_methods**: Comprised of standalone R/Python scripts, one for each deconvolution method and shell/batch scripts to execute the R or Python scripts in parallel for multiple instances in a removal scenario, <font color="blue">provided the required computational power is available</font>. Six of the eight methods are *R-based* (CARD, RCTD, SCDC, MuSiC, Seurat, SPOTlight), while two are *Python-based* (cell2location, Stereoscope). The Python-based methods <font color="blue"> expect GPU support </font>.<br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; The resulting deconvolution results for each removal scenario are available in the respective directory (for instance, the _**rm1**_ directory refers to the removal scenario for removing one cell type from scRNA-seq reference data). See below the overview of removal scenarios and total reference datasets in each scenario. <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 1. **<font color="brown">rm0</font>** - removal of _**no**_ cell types from reference data | one reference dataset <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 2. **<font color="brown">rm1</font>** - removal of _**one**_ cell type from reference data | 13 reference datasets <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 3. **<font color="brown">rm2</font>** - removal of _**two**_ cell types from reference data | 5 reference datasets <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 4. **<font color="brown">rm3</font>** - removal of _**three**_ cell types from reference data | 5 reference datasets <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 5. **<font color="brown">rm5</font>** - removal of _**five**_ cell types from reference data | 1 reference dataset <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 6. **<font color="brown">rm10</font>** - removal of _**ten**_ cell types from reference data | 5 reference datasets <br>
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; 7. **<font color="brown">rm11</font>** - removal of _**eleven**_ cell types from reference data | 5 reference datasets


* **4\_Analysis\_results**: Comprised of scripts to calculate similarity metrics like JSD and RMSE to understand the performance of deconvolution methods for various cell type removal scenarios compared to baseline with no cell type missing. Cell type reassignment metrics calculate the assignment of missing cell type proportions from the reference dataset.

* **5\_Post\_analysis\_work**: The directory comprises scripts to generate the final resulting plots in the project; few plots are included in the manuscript's main text, while others were included in the supplementary information.

* **Data**: Comprised of pre-processed data downloaded from a public data-sharing platform. One of the datasets is procured from the group of Lisa van Baarsen and is available on GEO as well with GEO accession ID - ####. <font color="brown">(not available in github repository)</font>

* **renv**: The project uses the renv functionality and the directory comprises the essential files and directories for the renv setup.

* **Renv_setup.R**: This script sets up the R environment for the project work. Details about executing are available in the file as a header and in the comments. Also included under the 'How to reproduce the results section further dowm in this document.<br>
**Please read the instructions in the file carefully before proceeding if you are using RStudio.**

* **renv.lock**: R environment lock (metadata) file comprising package details. This file will be used by the <font color="brown">*Renv_setup.R*</font> script to download and install the correct package and its version to recreate the computing environment.

* **.Rprofile**: Essential R profile script to set up the correct R profile while using the renv infrastructure.

* **environment.yml**: A metadata file comprising of python and/or packages installed in the virtual conda environment.

#### 1. Installation of 'fields' R package on macOS

The analysis is carried out with fields package version 13.3 developed under R version 4.1.2 and RStudio built for x86\_64 architecture.

If you use MacOS with arm\_64 architecture and install RStudio built for x86\_64 architecture, it will use the underlying 'Rosetta2' to run RStudio with x86\_64 architecture, and you will able to install the required 13.3 version of the fields package from CRAN archives.
But if you install RStudio built for arm\_64, it will run with the native silicon chip, and then you will get the error below,

```
 
</details>

to resolve this error, you can follow either option from below, 

- You can install the latest version 15.2 of fields R package ([R-binaries](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fields/index.html) available for arm\_64); this will affect the CARD package since it needs to be updated to the latest version as well.

- Install R and RStudio built for x86\_64 architecture and run the analysis using it. If you still get the same error, the compiler uses the default arm\_64 architecture to install R packages that need compilation.

<br>

#### 2. Compilation failed error on Windows OS

R and RStudio on Windows OS require rtools (a toolchain for building R and R packages). The correct version of rtools can be downloaded from [here](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/).

> <font color="red">Note:</font> Ensure you do not have white spaces in your paths while installing the rtools.

#### 3. Miniconda installation prompt

		No non-system installation of Python could be found.
		Would you like to download and install Miniconda?
		Miniconda is an open-source environment management system for Python.
		See https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html for more details.
		 
		Would you like to install Miniconda? [Y/n]:

If you see the above prompt in your execution attempt, press <font color="red">**n**</font> and stop the execution.

Please check your Python installation before proceeding. You can check this using `Sys.which("python")` or `Sys.which("python3")` in the RStudio console.

- If you see `" "`, please install the python version 3.9.7 (*or higher*) and try again.
- If you see `"/path_to_python_installation"`, please contact the developer or create an issue on the GitHub repository with the error message, R session info, and Python installation details (path, version, etc).

#### 4. RCTD parallel execution

If you come across the below error while executing the RCTD deconvolution method.

```
Error in checkForRemoteErrors(lapply(cl, recvResult)) :

```

This is a known issue when RCTD runs multiple jobs in parallel from within the deconvolution function. This has been reported to the developers earlier and can be found in the issues on the GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/dmcable/spacexr/issues/141)).

Please follow the solution available in the reported issue; if the problem persists, please raise an issue on GitHub.

<br>

#### 5. Creating conda virtual environment with environment.yml


The `environment.yml` is generated on the linux system and thus you can get error like below.

```
PackagesNotFoundError: The following packages are not available from current channels:

  - libstdcxx-ng=11.2.0*
  - libgomp=11.2.0*
  - libgcc-ng=11.2.0*
  - ld_impl_linux-64=2.40*
  - _openmp_mutex=5.1*
  - _libgcc_mutex=0.1*
```


Please comment out the lines in the `environment.yml` file with the package names that gave the error and rerun the command.
